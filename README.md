this browser extension swaps words and phrases on edsupportforum.com based off of a user-defined list and swaps the logo to a user-defined image. the swaps can be customised at script.js
it also has these keybinds:
-alt+q: opens a new tab set to google
-alt+a: closes all open EDSF tabs and opens a new tab set to google

it is available on all chromium-based browsers, but only tested on google chrome. to install it download this repo as a ZIP, unzip the ZIP, go to the extensions page on your browser, enable developer mode, click load unpacked and select the unzipped folder. it can not presently be turned on or off within the extension itself, so it must be toggled from the extensions menu

suggestions and bug reports should be posted on this thread https://www.edsupportforum.com/threads/i-made-a-browser-extension-that-helps-hide-edsf-browsing-in-public.4520413/ or dmed to achl_ys(preferably posted to the thread); bug reports should contain as much info as possible(your browser, OS, any modifications you made, any errors, what went wrong, what you were doing) I will work on improving its features and user-friendliness and possibly porting it to firefox

you are free to modify and distribute this code
