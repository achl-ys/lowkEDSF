this browser extension swaps words and phrases on edsupportforum.com based off of a user-defined list and swaps the logo to a user-defined image. the swaps can be customised at script.js
it also has these keybinds:
-alt+q: opens a new tab set to google
-alt+a: closes all open EDSF tabs and opens a new tab set to google

it is available on all chromium-based browsers, but only tested on google chrome. to install it go to extensions, enable developer mode, click load unpacked and select the parent folder. it can not presently be turned on or off within the extension itself, so it must be toggled from the extensions menu

suggestions and bug reports may be DMed to achl_ys on EDSF. I will work on improving its features and user-friendliness and possibly porting it to firefox
